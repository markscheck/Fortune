Captain Jean-Luc Picard: Space... The final frontier...These are the voyages of
the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: To explore strange new
worlds...To seek out new life and new civilizations...To boldly go where no one
has gone before!

Thou art directed to return to thine own solar system immediately.

But you can't deny that you're still a dangerous, savage child race.

 ...and 400 years before that, you were murdering each other in quarrels over
tribal god images. Since then, there are no indications that humans will ever
change.

If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.

Data: I am superior, sir, in many ways, but I would gladly give it up to be
human.  
William Riker: Nice to meet you... Pinocchio.  [Data stares at Riker]
William Riker: A joke.  
Data: Ah! Intriguing.  
William Riker: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data.

Admiral McCoy: Have you got some of a reason my atoms scattered all over space,
boy?
 Data: No, sir. But at your age, sir, I thought you shouldn't have to put
up with the time, and trouble of a shuttlecraft.
Admiral McCoy: Hold it right
there, boy?
Data: Sir?  Admiral McCoy: What about my age?
Data: Sorry, sir.If that subject troubles you...  
Admiral McCoy: Troubles me? What's so damn troublesome about not havin' died?
How old you think I am anyway?
Data: 137 years, Admiral, according to Starfleet records.
Admiral McCoy: Explain how you remembered that so exactly.
Data: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir.
Admiral McCoy: I don't see no points on your ears boy, but you sound like a
Vulcan.
Data: No, sir, I am an android.
Admiral McCoy: Almost as bad. 
Data:I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are an advanced, and most honorable race.
Admiral McCoy: They are, they are, and damn annoying at times.  
Data: Yes, sir.  
Admiral McCoy: Well, this is a new ship, but she's got the right name. Now you remember that you hear?
Data: I will sir.  Admiral
McCoy: You treat her like a lady, and she'll always bring you home.

Data: "There was a young lady from Venus, whose body was shaped like a..."
Jean-Luc Picard: [frantically cutting off Data] Captain to Security, come in!
Data: Did I say something wrong?  
Worf: I don't understand their humor, either.
-The Naked Now

Data:  We are more alike than unlike, my dear Captain. I have pores. Humans
have pores. I have... fingerprints. Humans have fingerprints. My chemical
nutrients are like your blood. If you prick me... do I not... leak?

Beverly Crusher: Where are the calluses we doctors are supposed to grow over
our feelings?  
Jean-Luc Picard: Perhaps the good ones never get them.  
--Code of Honor
%
Data: For example, what Lutan did is similar to what certain American Indians
once did called "counting coup." That is from an obscure language known as
French. "Counting coup..." 
Jean-Luc Picard: Mr. Data, the French language for centuries on Earth represented civilization.
Data: Indeed? But surely, sir...
William Riker: I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.  
Data: Yes, sir. "Counting coup" could be something as simple as touching an enemy with a stick in battle
or taking something from him and escaping.

Data: [his fingers in a Chinese finger trap] Apologies, Captain. I seem to have
reached an odd functional impasse. I am, uh... stuck.  
Jean-Luc Picard: Then get unstuck and continue with the briefing.
Data: Yes, sir. That is what I'm
trying to do, sir, but the solution eludes me.  
Geordi La Forge: My hero.

Data: If the Enterprise were really this fragile, sir, she never would have left
spacedock. Therefore, her systems' failures are not endemic to the ship,
but are the result of the actions of an unknown adversary.
William Riker: We have a saboteur aboard.  
Data: I believe I said that.

It's elementary, my dear Riker. Sir.

Jean-Luc Picard: Data! Don't babble. 
Data: Babble, sir? I am not aware that I ever babble, sir. It may be that from time to time I have considerable
information to communicate, and you may question the way in which I organize
it...

Die well, Captain!

William Riker: Removed from command, sir. And placed under guard for his act of
personal vengeance. Seems there was no profit in it. 
Jean-Luc Picard: In revenge, there never is.

Data: Could you please continue the petty bickering? I find it most intriguing.

Data: It was raining in the City by the Bay-- a hard rain. Hard enough to wash the slime...

Worf:My brother, it is you who does not see. You look for battles in the wrong place. 
The true test of a warrior is not without, it is within! Here! Here is where we meet the challenge. 
It is the weaknesses in here a warrior must overcome.

Paul Rice: Tell me about your ship - the Enterprise, isn't it?
William T. Riker: No... The name of my ship is the Lollipop.
Paul Rice: I have no knowledge of that ship.
William T. Riker: It's just been commissioned. It's a good ship.

Jean-Luc Picard: The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules; it is a philosophy...
and a very correct one. History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes
with a less developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that interference may be,
the results are invariably disastrous.
