Dr.Zefram Cochrane: On this site, a powerful engine will be built - an engine that will someday help us to travel a hundred times faster than we can today. Imagine it:thousands of inhabited planets at our fingertips. And we'll be able to explore those strange new worlds, and seek out new life and new civilizations. This engine will let us boldly go where no man has gone before.

[discussing about Travis parent's cargo ship.]
T'Pol: The Earth cargo ship Fortunate. Y-class freighter. Maximum speed: warp one point eight. Crew complement: twenty-three.
Travis: Not counting newborn babies.
Archer: Ensign?
Travis: I grew up on a J-class, a little smaller but the same basic design. And one thing I can tell you is that at warp one point eight, you've got a lot of time on your hands between ports. That's how my parents wound up with me.
T'Pol: Do you have any helpful information on this vessel beyond its recreational activities?

Archer: I have reconsidered. I spent the whole night reconsidering, and what I've decided goes against all my principles. Someday my people are going to come up with some sort of a doctrine, something that tells us what we can and can't do out here, should and shouldn't do. But until somebody tells me that they've drafted that directive I'm going to have to remind myself every day that we didn't come out here to play God.

Tucker: With all due respect sir... This is a level of quantum engineering that's beyond anything I ever learned. How the hell do you know this?
--Shockwave
%
Archer: When I was in my early 20s on a trip to East Africa, I saw a gazelle giving birth. It was truly amazing. Within minutes, the baby was standing up... standing up on its own. A few more minutes, and it was walking. And before I knew it, it was running alongside its mother, moving away with the herd. Humans aren't like that, Ambassador. We may come from the same planet as those gazelles, but we're pretty much helpless when we're born. It takes us months before we're able to crawl. Almost a full year before we can walk. Our deep space mission isn't much different. We're going to stumble, make mistakes. I'm sure more than a few before we find our footing. But we're going to learn from those mistakes. That's what being Human is all about. I'm sorry you can't see that.
--Shockwave
%
Trip: Do realize you've just rewritten our history books?
T'Pol: A footnote at best.
Trip: Footnote? This is like finding out Neil Armstrong wasn't the first man to walk on the moon.

T'Pol: Are you feeling alright Commander?
Trip: ...I know you don't think this chair is important, but you're wrong. What's the most critical component on this ship? The main computer? The Warp Reactor? Huh...?! It's the crew. And the most important member of the crew is the captain. He makes life and death decisions every day, and the last thing he needs to be thinking in a critical situation is: 'Gee! I wish this chair wouldn't such pain in the ass!'
--Singularity
%
Phlox: Transporter technology is very new. I'm sure Humans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced, or the airplane. New forms of transport take a while to get used to. I'm not at all surprised at your reaction. You wouldn't catch me using that apparatus.
--Vanishing Point
%
Hoshi: Ever since I used that transporter, nothing has been the way that it's supposed to be. I couldn't translate a simple bimodal syntax but Crewman Baird could. Crewman Baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguistic database! And Captain Archer told me to stay in my quarters, but my mirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can't decide whether to bounce off me or go through me! And nobody wants to talk to me.

Archer: (talking about Zefram Cochrane) He was giving a commencement address at Princeton when he started to talk about what really happened during First Contact. He mentioned a group of cybernetic creatures from the future who tried to stop his first warp flight when he was living in Montana. He said they were defeated by a group of humans, who were also from the future.
T'Pol: As I recall, Cochrane was famous for his imaginative stories. He was also known to be frequently intoxicated.

Robinson: (to Archer) You're a great pilot. Maybe as good as me. But you're never gonna get out into deep space by playing it safe. When the first warp 5 starship is built, it's captain won't be able to call home every time he needs to make a decision. He won't be able to turn to the Vulcans... unless he decides to take one with him.

T'Pol: You think that the loss of a colleague or a friend doesn't affect us? It does, but if we give in to those emotions, they overwhelm us. You're the ones to be envied.
<hr width="50%" />
Archer: We're in bad shape. I can't deny that, but we're still in one piece. Enterprise is a tough ship. She took more then anyone could ask her to and then some. And so have all of you. I wanted to say thank you. I only wish I could thank the eighteen crewmen who were lost. Like you, they understood how important our mission is and they accepted the risks. We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find. With no one to rely on but ourselves, but we're going to succeed. To accomplish our mission. For everyone on Earth who's relying on us and for the eighteen.

Soval: Captain, your actions, while being morally questionable... were necessary. I opposed your appointment as captain of the Enterprise, but it's obvious now I was wrong. T'Pol told me that the Expanse would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including Vulcan. You've done a great service for both our worlds... Thank you.

Archer: I've been told that people are calling us heroes. When it comes to my crew, you won't get any argument from me. But I think that it's important that we remember the heroes who aren't with us -- the 27 crewmen who didn't make it back. Without their sacrifice, I wouldn't be standing here now; none of us would. But I'm sure I speak on behalf of my entire crew when I say -- it's good to be home.

Soval: Of all the species we've made contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have the arrogance of the Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellerites. One moment you're as driven by your emotions as Klingons and the next you confound us by suddenly embracing logic.
<hr width="50%" />
Admiral Forrest: Ambassador,... Are Vulcans afraid of humans? [Soval says nothing] Why?
Soval: Because there is one species you remind us of.
Admiral Forrest: [realizing] Vulcans.
Soval: We had our wars, Admiral. Just as humans did. Our planet was devastated, our civilization nearly destroyed. Logic saved us. But it took almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world and travel to the stars. You humans did the same in less than a century. There are those on the High Command who wonder what humans would achieve in the century to come. And they don't like the answer.
Admiral Forrest: We're not the Klingons. We only want to be your partners. To do what the nations of Earth have learned to do. To work together in common cause.

Soval: You must know that torture is rarely effective against Vulcans. Our mental disciplines allow us to suppress pain.

Archer: Up until about 100 years ago, there was one question that burned in every human, that made us study the stars and dream of traveling to them. Are we alone? Our generation is privileged to know the answer to that question. We are all explorers driven to know what's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores. And yet the more I've experienced, the more I've learned that no matter how far we travel, or how fast we get there, the most profound discoveries are not necessarily beyond that next star. They're within us, woven into the threads that bind us, all of us, to each other. A final frontier begins in this hall. Let's explore it together.
